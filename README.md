# ANN-Representation
<B>Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Representations<B>
This repository contains code examples and implementations of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) representations using three widely used libraries: NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a fundamental concept in machine learning and deep learning. They consist of interconnected nodes, mimicking the structure of the human brain, and have been used for various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

In this repository, we provide code examples and implementations of ANNs using three popular libraries:

NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing with Python, and it provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, as well as mathematical functions.

PyTorch: PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library known for its flexibility and dynamic computation graphs. It's widely used in research and production environments.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning library developed by Google. It's known for its ease of use and scalability.
